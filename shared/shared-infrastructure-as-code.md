# Deploy infrastructure as code for reference architectures 
{: #shared-deploy-infrastructure-as-code}

[Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/infrastructure-as-code){: external} automates the provisioning of infrastructure, enabling your organization to develop, deploy, and scale cloud applications with greater speed, less risk, and reduced cost. With that in mind, a toolchain for {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_full}} has been developed to automate deploying different flavors of the [VPC reference architecture](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-about).
{: shortdesc}

To get started, visit the [Deploy infrastructure as code for the IBM Cloud for Financial Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https%3A%2F%2Fus-east.git.cloud.ibm.com%2Fopen-toolchain%2Flanding-zone&env_id=ibm:yp:us-east){: external} toolchain and follow the instructions. 

For more information, see the following:

* [Documentation for the toolchain](https://github.com/open-toolchain/landing-zone){: external}
* [Source code](https://us-east.git.cloud.ibm.com/open-toolchain/landing-zone/tree/main){: external}
