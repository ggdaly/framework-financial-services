# Deploy infrastructure as code for reference architectures 
{: #shared-deploy-infrastructure-as-code}


Automation is an important part of any cloud solution, and it's even more so in regulated industries. You want to ensure that your deployment, operations, and management procedures are secure and repeatable. Manual activities can be error prone and lead to the introduction of vulnerabilities. With that in mind, a toolchain for {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_full}} has been developed to automate deploying different flavors of the [VPC reference architecture](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-about).
{: shortdesc}

To get started, visit the [Deploy infrastructure as code for the IBM Cloud for Financial Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https%3A%2F%2Fus-east.git.cloud.ibm.com%2Fopen-toolchain%2Flanding-zone&env_id=ibm:yp:us-east){: external} toolchain and follow the instructions. 

For more information, see the following:

* [Documentation for the toolchain](https://github.com/open-toolchain/landing-zone){: external}
* [Source code](https://us-east.git.cloud.ibm.com/open-toolchain/landing-zone/tree/main){: external}
