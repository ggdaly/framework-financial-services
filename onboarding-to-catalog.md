# Onboarding to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog
{: #onboarding-to-catalog}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog lists {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} and third-party services and software that a user can create. As an application provider from a technology vendor, you are encouraged to onboard your offering to the catalog.
{: shortdesc}

You do not need to be [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services Validated](/docs/allowlist/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-about#becoming-fs-validated) to be listed in the catalog. If you have potential consumers who do not require the Financial Services Validated designation, being listed in the catalog enables you to market to those consumers while you're working toward becoming Financial Services Validated.
{: tip}

To onboard to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog, follow the guidance for services or software.
